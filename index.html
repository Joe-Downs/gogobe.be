      <h1>Welcome to my website, <em>gogobe.be!</em></h1>
      <p>
	  I'm a second-year Computer Science and Engineering major as of 2020.
	  This is merely a personal website for me to practice HTML, CSS, and other
	  server-related programs and languages.
      </p>
      <p>
	  Obviously this website is under-development. My intention is to improve it as I
	  learn more about HTML and CSS.
