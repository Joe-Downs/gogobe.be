		<h1>Welcome to my website, <em>gogobe.be!</em></h1>
		<p>
		    I'm a second-year Computer Science and Engineering major as of 2020.
		    This is merely a personal website for me to practice HTML, CSS, and other
		    server-related programs and languages.
		</p>
		<p>
		    Obviously this website is under-development. My intention is to improve it as I
		    learn more about HTML and CSS.
