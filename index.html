	<h1>Welcome to my website, <em>gogobe.be!</em></h1>
	<p>
	    I'm a second-year Computer Science and Engineering major as of 2020.
	    This is merely a personal website for me to practice HTML, CSS, and other
	    server-related programs and languages.
	</p>
	<p>
	    Obviously this website is under-development. My intention is to improve it as I
	    learn more about HTML and CSS.
